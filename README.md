website for the bills sonoma

to build site locally (for teests):
- [install ruby 2.1.0 or higher](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/). check with `ruby --version`
- install bundler. run: `gem install bundler`
- run `bundle install`
- that's it! now just run `bundle exec jekyll serve` to view the site locally :) 

note: if you run into an issue that says 'Could not locate Gemfile', it's possibly a line ending issue. open the gemfile in vim and write & quit, and try again. if that doesn't fix it please contact @sabeegrewal
